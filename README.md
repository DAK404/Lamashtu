## Description
Lamashtu was based on Mosaic, with new features and functionalities. This meant that the quality of code and the program efficiency were bad.

The entire project was taken up as a fresh project and the code was completely rewritten, with Lamashtu as the reference. Eventually as the code was cleaned up and improved, this project was deemed obsolete.

The code is uploaded here as a part of the Nion projects for future reference. Although the current iterations of the implementation of the code may differ from Lamashtu, the current projects do have a few components from which the inspiration for the same can still be found from here.

Thank you for checking this Repository out! Please check Truncheon for the updated code!
